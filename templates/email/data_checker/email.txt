Howdy, Admin!


The following are the missing ranges (inclusive) that you should be aware of.

FROM
{% for dt in current %}
    {{ forloop.counter }} {{ dt }}
{% endfor %}

TO
{% for prev_dt in previous %}
    {{ forloop.counter }} {{ prev_dt }}
{% endfor %}

MODEL
{% for model in models %}
    {{ forloop.counter }} {{ model }}
{% endfor %}
